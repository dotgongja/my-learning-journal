# In what environment does a coder code?

## Code Editors

A code editor is where programmers will spend majority of their time. Choosing a good text editor will enable you to write and manage text to build a website. A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
