        <h3>The ABC's of programming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a script and how do I create one?</li>          
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>A script is a series of instrcutions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal</li>
            <li>Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instrcutions</li>
            <li>Computer approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically</li>
            <li>To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complate that task</li>
        </ol>
        <br>        
        <h3>Basic Javascript Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe</li>
            <li>Javascript distringuishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (T or F)</li>
            <li>Expressions valuate into a single value</li>
            <li>Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What is a Function?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>function sayHello() {
                            document.write ('Hello!');
                    }
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
